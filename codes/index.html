In addition he/she is supposed to have solved all the tasks he/she had <br> been issued with by his/her trainer. Upon completion of the following task, he/she is supposed to return the <br> completed circuit to his/her trainer who will determine whether the circuit contains errors or not. If not <br> the learner shall have qualified to proceed to the next programming stage i.e. Flood2.)<hr></i><h2 style=" text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: wavy;">
Task</h2>Develop a well-designed circuit for a device that has the following capabilities: Has a button for switching on its beam <br>light and another button b for switching on the flood light. Has button c for switching on the propeller and finally <br>button d for switching off anything on. (All the buttons should be single tap). The device is rechargeable and has LEDâ€™s <br>to indicate that it is charging. Upon pressing button d to switch off anything that is on, the lights should first delay <br>then shrink off. This device is 12volts DC operated; the LED indicators are 5volts DC operated and the lights and the <br>propeller are also 12volts DC operated.
